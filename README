This project attempts to choose the best type of logistic regression model to predict the results of the 2012-2015 NCAA tournaments using detailed regular season data for all the teams in the association.  We have used LASSO, Elastic Net, Ridge and Bayesian GLM methods to do the logistic regression. After comparing the prediction rates of each round for each method across the 2012-2015 tournaments, we considered the Ridge methods as the best model. Bayesian GLM came to the second. LASSO and Elastic Net performed almost the same, but not as good as the other two methods. Finally, we also explain ways in which our models could be improved upon, specificallly dealing with upsets and toking the historic results into account.
